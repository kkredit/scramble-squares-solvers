## The Puzzle

[Scramble Squares](https://www.scramblesquares.com/) puzzles make good for a fun programming problem. The problem small
enough for a single-file implementation, but complex enough to make you think.

Scramble Squares puzzles consist of nine square pieces that fit together to make a larger 3x3 square. In the solution,
all interior edges must match.

This repo contains many solutions to [one particular
puzzle](https://www.scramblesquares.com/shop/nature/insects-scramble-squares/). In this puzzle, edges contain either the
head or the tail of one of four insects. Here's a picture of what it looks like unsolved:

## Solutions

This project is starting with solutions in five languages. I originally wrote a solution in C when my primary motivation
was solving the puzzle. I added solutions in Clojure, Go, Haskell, and Rust when my motivation was learning new
languages. You can read a little more about that experience [here](https://github.com/kkredit/scramble-squares-solver).

Solving this problem in new languages was a pleasure. I hope you will share in it by submitting your own solution! If
you follow the [guidelines below](#submission-guidelines) and submit a merge request, I will approve it and add your
solution to the list.

Currently implemented languages:

- C
- Clojure
- Go
- Haskell
- Rust

## Submission Guidelines

Before submitting a solution, please meet the following guidelines:

1. Include a comment at the top of the file with your name and a reference to the CC0-1.0 license
1. Write a Makefile such that produces an executable called `bin/puzzle`
1. Implement the solution such that it prints 1-4 (including rotations) solutions in a somewhat readable format

For languages that do not produce an executable, `bin/puzzle` may be a shell script that invokes your program. See the
Clojure solution as an example. Either you or I can update the root Makefile and Dockerfile, and optionally add the
solution to the benchmarking script.

<!--
Ideas

- Update benchmark.sh to collect more stats and name champions for each language
  - code golf (no non-standard libraries)
  - execution time
  - memory usage
- Maybe document all the algorithms employed
-->

## Benchmarks

These benchmarks are just for fun, as many cross-language comparisons are not fair. [scc](https://github.com/boyter/scc)
is used for the LOC and complexity measurements. Build time, runtime and memory usage are on whatever machine on which I
last ran the benchmarking script.

If you want your solution to be benchmarked, add it to the list at the top of `benchmark.sh`.
